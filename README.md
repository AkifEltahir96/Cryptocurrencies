# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and create a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for individuals who are considering joining the cryptocurrency market. Here, we will generate a report that includes information on which cryptocurrencies are on the market and how to classify them regarding a new investment. The report will detail an unsupervised machine learning model used to complete this process and use visualizations to display findings of the machine learning model.
